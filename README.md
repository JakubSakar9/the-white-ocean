# The White Ocean

An atmospheric audio-based video game.

## How to run

The game was created in Godot 2.2. In order to build, clone the repository to a folder and open it as a Godot project. The game uses the Forward+ rendering method, so not all platforms will work properly.

If you wish to play the game without building it, visit the [itch.io page](https://jetsy.itch.io/the-white-ocean).
